# CS2043-Course-Project
This program is intended to bin grades based off of a default distribution scheme, or a user inputted one.
It takes in text files to create student and course objects, and allows the user to generate specific student transcripts, explore raw distributions across all students,
and look specifically at course areas that are of interest and how grades are distributed across those courses
